                <h2 class="mb-5">My story</h2>
                <p>I've been interested in how things around us work since I was a child and I was particularly fascinated by the Universe. This brought me to astronomy, physics and mathematics. As a student I started participating in science olympiads, which are the competitions for young students until the end of high school where they need to solve various problems. I was interested in olympiads in astronomy, physics and mathematics and I was particularly successful in astronomy olympiad where I managed to place well in national and international rounds.&nbsp;I even brought two times bronze medal from the International Olympiad in Astronomy and Astrophysics.</p>
                <p>I was motivated by successes in competitions and I was deepening my knowledge in these subjects. At the end of the high school, I got a chance to take part in the student internship at the Astronomical Institute of Czech Academy od Sciences and I worked with autonomous robotic telescopes, developing software for automated processing of astronomical images and identification of variable stars. This project was awarded at the national student scientific fair (SOČ) and selected for the presentation at the international MILSET Expo in Brussels.</p>
                <p>My interest in astronomy and physics made me chose physics as a field that I wanted to study at the university. For my bachelor's I studied general physics at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University in Prague and I finished thesis focused on testing of silicon strip detectors for the upgrade of the ATLAS experiment at CERN. This helped me to pick the subject of my master's studies and I continued at the same faculty and I studied nuclear and subnuclear physics. For my thesis I decided to continue in the work from my bachelor thesis and I worked on the computer simulations of silicon strip detectors.</p>
                <p>Apart form physics, I love sports and adventures. I have been climbing since I was ten years old but during my studies at the university, I started training on scooter (non-electric, see pictures) and participated in competitions, but I also used it as a way to go for a big adventures and did together with my brother several big trips across Europe. The longest one was after I finished my master's and it was 3 800 kilometres from the Czech Republic to Nordkapp - the northernmost point of Europe, which took us little over one month. It was a great adventure to do after my university studies in Prague.</p>

                <p>I enjoyed particle physics and I decided to continue in academia as a doctoral student because it was the natural way how to stay in cutting edge research in particle physics and I also wanted to get some international experience which I was missing in my previous studies. I got accepted to the group of professor Anna Sfyrla at the University of Geneva and I joined the international team and got to work on two experiments at CERN - experiments ATLAS and FASER. I learned new things from programming and electronics when I worked on the development and commissioning of the trigger and data acquisition system for (at that time) newly built FASER experiment. I also got to work in the jet-trigger group of the ATLAS experiment, where I qualified as an author by optimising algorithm that is used for the track extrapolation in the jet reconstruction in the high-level trigger. On top of that, I joined the team searching for higgsinos (particles predicted by the Supersymmetry) and worked on the analysis of the data from proton-proton collisions collected by the ATLAS experiment between years 2015-2018. Finally, in October 2024, I defended my doctoral thesis titled "Searching for new physics using the ATLAS and FASER detectors".</p>
                <p>But things didn't always go so smoothly. I started my Ph.D. two month before the outburst of the COVID pandemic, and so the first year of my doctorate was heavily influenced by lockdowns. Staying in the new country and being isolated from my family, and colleagues and friends in Geneva due to closed borders and lockdown (I lived on the French side) wasn't easy. But I managed to find something positive about the situation and I learned how to play ukulele and later transitioned to guitar. I am no musician, but I loved the learning proces and I picked up a new hobby.</p>
                <p>After I finished my Ph.D., I wanted to do a big adventure to get some mental rest but also to have time for thinking about my future steps. Driven by motto "go big, or go home" I decided to fly to New Zealand and walk the length of the country on Te Araro trail. Te Araroa is 3 040 km long trail going through challenging terrains in New Zealand, covering both islands, with more than 82 000 meters of positive elevation gain.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Te Araroa was a big adventure, but also a transforming experience. Not only it was a huge adventure and challenge but I also learned a lot of things about myself and I had time to think. I like science but I got to the conclusion that I would like to use my experience gained during my studies and apply it outside of academia. Time to embark on the new adventures!</p>
